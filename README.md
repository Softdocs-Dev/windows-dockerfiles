# Windows DockerFiles 

The intent of this project is to share some of our windows dockerfiles which we use in our processes as Softdocs. This enables us to contribute to the Open-source community. 

## Getting Started

To use this project you need to be running a form of windows with docker installed. Look at Microsoft's support for windows containers => https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/version-compatibility?tabs=windows-server-2016%2Cwindows-10-1909 .

### Prerequisites
